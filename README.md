Hi, I’m @rcleong194

I’m interested in creating games and working in game engines. I also find XR technologies really interesting and have worked on multiple VR simulations, VR games and a couple of "normal" games in Unity.

I’m currently learning Unreal 5 and know the basics of CPP. I also have an interest in DevOps in a general sense and have experimented with AWS. I'm also currently checking out what Docker and .NetCore are about.
